# Manufacturing an "Eco-capsule"
## About
This is an attempt to create a concept shell using 3D printing and laser cutting in HTAM course.
## Design Concept
  In 2044, artificial intelligence evolved into "environmental intelligence". And the Arduino box, which seemed rather rudimentary in 2024, has now evolved into an astonishing product: Eco-Capsule. 
  This product is equipped with precise environmental sensors that can detect data far beyond what human senses can perceive, such as changes in subtle compounds in the air, the condition of the surrounding soil, and the electrical signals released by plants, etc. 
  Its core function is to "translate" all of this into a language that humans can understand, and then convey the information through the speaker, such as "The little daisy on the balcony is currently very content. The amount of water today is just right", "The indoor carbon dioxide concentration has increased, and it is necessary to open the windows for ventilation". 
  This capsule will become a smart entity in our living environment.
  
  2044年，人工智能进化成了“环境智能”，而在2024年看起来略显简陋的Arduino盒子，已经进化成了一个令人惊叹的产品：Eco-Capsule。
  这个产品内置了精准的环境传感器，能感知远超人类感官的数据，例如空气中的细微化合物变化、周边土壤的状况、植物释放的电信号等等。
  它的核心功能是将这一切“翻译”成人类可以理解的语言，并通过扬声器向人类传达信息，例如“阳台上的小雏菊此刻感到非常满足，今天的水分恰到好处”，“室内二氧化碳浓度升高，需要开窗通风”。
  这个胶囊将成为我们生活环境中一个智慧的存在。
